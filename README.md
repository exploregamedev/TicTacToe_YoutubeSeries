# TicTacToe YoutubeSeries

This is a Tic Tac Toe game written using the Godot game engine. It was developed over a series of
[YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2EYHD7CRNYV57mQnRcnJNuFwZcvGVyhj).  Each video builds upon the previous one, adding functionality
to the game.  For reference, you'll find the ending state code for each lesson in the appropriate 
folder, e.g. `01_Starting_prototype`, `02_Win_detection`.
